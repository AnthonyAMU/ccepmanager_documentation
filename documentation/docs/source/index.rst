CCEP Manager's documentation
****************************

CCEP Manager is a standalone implementation of the `F-Tract <https://f-tract.eu/>`_ analysis pipeline 
allowing the processing of iEEG data coupled with electrical stimulation
for the extraction of Cortico-Cortical Evoked Potentials (CCEP) features and the generation of connectivity atlases.

CCEP Manager documentation covers all aspects of the software, including its :ref:`dependencies and requirements<prerequisites>`,
a description of its :ref:`interface<Main UI>`, the details of the various :ref:`processing steps<processing data>`
and the :ref:`tools<tools>` available to explore and further analyze the data.

The :ref:`quick start<quick start>` chapter could be a serviceable introduction to the general purpose
and usage of the software.  

CCEP Manager is also available on the Human Intracerebral EEG Platform (:ref:`HIP<HIP>`).
